# Surfs Up

------
## Overview
When planning a business centered on outdoor recreation, it is critical to consider your environment. To determine whether a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, the temperature should be included in that analysis. With the premise that June and December are typically the most extreme weather opposites, let's look into the variations.

## Results
June and December in Oahu appear to have similar temperatures, but there are important variations to consider:
- There are more datapoints to support June weather: 1700 vs 1517 in December.
- December's temperatures have dropped as low as 56 degrees, and June's coolest day was at 64 degrees.
- The variation in the temperatures is greater in December (std = 3.75) than in June (std = 3.26)

## Summary
Ultimately, June and December appear to have temperatures conducive to surfing and consuming ice cream. Both have highs in the 80s and lows in the 50s-60s, and average temp in the 70s. There is a 3-degree drop in temperature in December, as compared to June, on average. However, the lowest drop in December - to the mid-50s - may deter some traffic. 

### Alternate Considerations
 - Were June and December the most extreme temperature variations in Oahu? Consider pulling a query to confirm the 20 highest and lowest temperatures occur in June and December. If another month shows more extreme temperatures, use that month in this analysis instead.
 - What other factors might affect interest in a surf & ice cream shop? Within weather parameters, wind or rain could have tremendous impact.
