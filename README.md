# Surfs Up
A comparison of June and December temperatures in Oahu from 2010-2017
------
## Overview
When planning a business centered on outdoor recreation, it is critical to consider the environment. To determine whether a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, the temperature should be included in that analysis. With the premise that June and December are typically the most extreme weather opposites, let's look into the temperature variations in Oahu.

## Results
June and December in Oahu appear to have similar temperatures, but there are important variations to consider:
- There are more datapoints to support June weather: 1700 vs 1517 in December.
- December's temperatures have dropped as low as 56 degrees, whereas June's coolest day was 64 degrees.
- The variation in the temperatures is greater in December (std = 3.75) than in June (std = 3.26).

## Summary
Ultimately, June and December appear to have temperatures conducive to surfing and consuming ice cream. Both have highs in the 80s and average temperatures in the 70s. There is a 3-degree drop in temperature in December, as compared to June, on average. However, the lowest drop in December - to the mid-50s - may deter some traffic. That said, since most December days are in the 70s, weather allowing good business throughout December is extremely likely.

### Alternate Considerations
 - Do June and December have the most extreme temperature variations in Oahu? Let's confirm the 20 highest and lowest temperatures occur in June and December. If another month shows more extreme temperatures, let's use that month in this analysis instead.
   - Perhaps December gets particularly chilly toward the end of the month, and continues cooling off through the Winter months. Seeing the daily average temperature as a chart could be beneficial to establish a possible "winter season".
 - What other factors might affect interest in a surf & ice cream shop? Within weather parameters, wind or rain could have tremendous impact. Outside of that we can factor in seasonal tourist waves, water temperature, and wave intensity trends.
